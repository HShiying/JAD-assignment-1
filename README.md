# JAD-assignment-1  
A JSP-based web application for managing elderly care services, built for the ST0510 Java Applications Development module.

Silver Care allows clients to browse services, make bookings, confirm appointments, and leave feedback, while administrators manage services, categories, clients, and reviews.  
The system follows proper MVC structure (Model–View–Controller), uses a MySQL database, and is deployed using Apache Tomcat.

- `Feedback`
- `Booking` *(Pending / Confirmed)*
- `BookingDetails`

### **Controller Layer (Servlets)**
- `AuthController`
- `CartController`
- `BookingController`
- `FeedbackController`
- CRUD controllers for services & categories

### **DAO Layer**
- `ClientDao`
- `AdminDao`
- `ServiceDao`
- `CategoryDao`
- `FeedbackDao`
- `CartDao` *(booking + booking_details logic)*

### **View Layer**

  - `/admin`
  - `/booking`
  - `/includes` (navbar, footer, header)

## 🗄 Database Schema

### **Tables**
- `admin(admin_id, username, password)`
- `client(client_id, full_name, email, password, phone, address)`
- `service_category(category_id, category_name, description)`
- `service(service_id, category_id, name, description, price, image_path)`
- `booking(booking_id, client_id, status, created_at)`
- `booking_details(detail_id, booking_id, service_id)`
- `feedback(feedback_id, client_id, service_id, rating, comments, created_at)`

### **Booking Workflow**
- Client adds service → `booking_details` item is created  
- If no pending booking exists → system auto-creates `booking(Pending)`  
- On checkout → status updates to `Confirmed`, feedback becomes available
